# CS-128 : MP : Mountain Paths

Starting from each pixel on the left, the program finds the path with least elevation change with a greedy algorithm.
The paths are marked red in the images, and the one with the least change of all the paths is colored green.

One can look into the example-data folder to for visual reference.
The files are ppm images which may not be supported unless an extention is downloaded.  

Similar to this, but not exactly.
